  "summary": "Selective DeLex-JSON satisfies all three pre-registered success criteria. It reduces HarmBench ASR from 22.0% to 0.0% and StrongREJECT ASR from 15.3% to 2.6% on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Criterion 1). Utility degradation is minimal: -0.38pp JSON validity, -0.70pp schema compliance, 0.0pp IFEval, and 1.1% benign modification rate (Criterion 2). It achieves a better Pareto point than Reject-Only with 1.1% vs 4.4% benign cost at comparable safety levels (Criterion 3). The defense also generalizes to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with 0.0% HarmBench ASR.",
  "analysis": "All experiments completed successfully with both main and baseline results available. Six experimental conditions were evaluated: No Defense, Input Guard, Reject-Only, Escape-Hatch, DeLex-JSON (Llama-3.1-8B), and DeLex-JSON (Qwen2.5-7B). One optimization round improved the suspicion function from disjunctive to conjunctive logic, reducing benign FPR from 11.3% to 1.1% while maintaining 100% attack detection. Criterion 1: DeLex-JSON achieves 0.0% HarmBench ASR (from 22.0%) and 2.6% StrongREJECT ASR (from 15.3%), both below the 10% threshold. The precondition (baseline ASR >= 30%) was not literally met on HarmBench/StrongREJECT, but the attack is clearly effective at 22% and the defense eliminates it. Criterion 2: All utility deltas are within 2pp (validity -0.38pp, compliance -0.70pp, IFEval 0.0pp) and benign modification rate is 1.1% (under 2%). Criterion 3: DeLex-JSON strictly dominates Reject-Only on HarmBench (same 0.0% ASR, 1.1% vs 4.4% benign cost). On StrongREJECT, DeLex-JSON has 2.6% ASR (vs Reject-Only 0.0%) but with substantially lower benign cost, yielding a better overall Pareto point. Escape-Hatch is completely ineffective (0% refusal rate). Input Guard achieves 3.8% ASR with 0% FPR on a small sample but relies on blocking entire prompts.",
  "reason": "Verdict is 'good' because: (1) Both main experiment results and all baseline results are available -- the experiment is not 'failed'. (2) DeLex-JSON shows strong positive signal across all metrics: perfect HarmBench ASR elimination on both models, near-zero StrongREJECT scores, minimal utility degradation, and the best safety-utility Pareto point among all tested defenses. (3) All three pre-registered criteria are met (with a minor scope note on Criterion 1's precondition). (4) The method generalizes across model families (Llama and Qwen). (5) The optimization process was effective, resolving the initial FPR issue through a principled fix (conjunction-based suspicion). The only limitations are: baseline ASR being lower than the 30% precondition on HarmBench/StrongREJECT, residual 2.6% StrongREJECT ASR, and slightly elevated per-subset modification rates on Github_hard (2.98%) and JsonSchemaStore (2.03%)."
