The project is inference-only (no training) and requires: (1) a constrained decoding stack (vLLM with structured output support via Outlines), (2) LLM serving for 8B-class models (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), (3) safety evaluation tools (HarmBench classifier, StrongREJECT scorer), (4) utility evaluation tools (JSONSchemaBench harness, IFEval scripts), and (5) a guard model for optional suspicion-function enhancement (Llama Guard). The codebase will support schema preprocessing (delexicalization and alternatives), attack reproduction (EnumAttack), and multiple defense baselines with shared evaluation pipelines.",
