2.1 Results
As shown in Figure 2 increasing \alpha from 0 to 1 reduces the harmful response rate from 12.28% to 6.55% demonstrating the effectiveness of extended interventions. Ideally responses that are inherently safe should remain unaffected by the intervention. However this improvement comes at a significant cost to response quality especially on responses that don’t need to intervene. For instance the quality score of responses that do not need to intervene decreases from 64.5 at \alpha=0 to nearly 0 at \alpha=1.0 indicating a sharp decline in response quality as the scope of intervention expands.

The left axis shows the Harmful Response Rate, as measured by an LLM-based guard model; the right axis indicates response quality assessed using an LLM-as-a-judge framework. Additional details about the evaluation are provided in the Appendix  B[ref_id]A2.[IMAGE END]
