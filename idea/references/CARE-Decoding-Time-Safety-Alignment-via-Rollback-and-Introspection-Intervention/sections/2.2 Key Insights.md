2.2 Key Insights
Our findings reveal a critical trade-off between safety and response quality in decoding-time interventions: Effective interventions often comes at the cost of a sharp decline in response quality. This suggests that indiscriminate application of interventions across all queries and tokens leads to excessive disruption of benign content undermining usability.
 Therefore we argue that future intervention strategies must move beyond uniform full-sequence interventions and instead adopt more targeted approaches. Instead the intervention should only occur on malicious queries and should not affect parts of the response that are not related to the malicious content.
