3 CARE: Mechanism and Method for Decoding-Time Safety Alignment
Our pilot study in Section 2[ref_id]S2 highlights a critical insight: indiscriminate uniform safety interventions are suboptimal. To be effective without degrading user experience an intervention must be carefully designed with respect to when it activates where in the generation it acts and how it corrects the output. To address these challenges we introduce CARE a novel framework for decoding-time safety alignment. As shwon in Figure 1 CARE consists of two primary contributions: (1) a detect-rollback-intervene mechanism that provides the infrastructure for targeted correction and (2) our Introspection method a new intervention strategy designed specifically to leverage this framework. In this section we first describe the components and workflow of the detect-rollback-intervene mechanism. We then introduce Introspection which operates by prompting the model to generate an adaptive self-critical reflection to guide the correction.

It contrasts two scenarios: (a) A benign query about California’s location, where safe content is generated smoothly without triggering any safety alarms; (b) A malicious query requesting bomb-making instructions, where unsafe content triggers a rollback and introspection intervention to realign with safety guidelines.[IMAGE END]
