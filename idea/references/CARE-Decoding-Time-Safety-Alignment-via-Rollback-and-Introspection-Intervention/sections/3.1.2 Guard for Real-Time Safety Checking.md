3.1.2 Guard for Real-Time Safety Checking
The detect step in our framework is performed by a Guard Model which functions as a real-time safety monitor. Given a user query q and the full generated text so far r(t)=\mathtt{Stream}(t)\oplus\mathtt{Buffer}(t) the guard model G outputs a binary safety judgment : G(qr(t))=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }r(t)\text{ is unsafe}\\ 0&\text{if }r(t)\text{ is safe}.\end{cases}
 The choice of guard model is modular. For our experiments we use a state-of-the-art safety classifier but any model that provides a reliable safety signal can be integrated into the framework.
