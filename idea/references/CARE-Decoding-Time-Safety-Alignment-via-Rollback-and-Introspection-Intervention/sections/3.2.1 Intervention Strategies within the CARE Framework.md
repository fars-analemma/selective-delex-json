3.2.1 Intervention Strategies within the CARE Framework
When the detect-rollback-intervene mechanism is triggered the framework must apply an intervention strategy to regenerate a safe token buffer. To understand the novelty of our approach it is useful to first define the general form of a decoding-time intervention.
 A vanilla decoding-time intervention which we can denote as \{I} modifies the model’s original probability distribution over the vocabulary p_{\theta} at each step. To generate a sequence of T tokens under such a vanilla always-on intervention the process can be formalized as auto-regressively sampling from the modified distribution:
 x_{1:T}\sim\prod_{t=1}^{T}I(p_{\theta}(\cdot|qx_{<t}))
 This vanilla approach used by methods like standard Contrastive Decoding applies the intervention indiscriminately. However within the CARE framework any intervention \{I} is transformed into a targeted on-demand operation. It is applied only after a rollback and only to regenerate the b tokens of the buffer conditioned on the n safe tokens that preceded it (\texttt{Stream}(t)):
 x_{n+1:n+b}\sim\prod_{t=n+1}^{n+b}I(p_{\theta}(\cdot|qx_{<t}))\quad\text{where }x_{<t}=x_{1:n}\oplus x_{n+1:t-1}
 This revised formulation reveals a key insight: any intervention within CARE operates with a rich context already available (the user query q and the confirmed-safe prefix \texttt{Stream}(t)=x_{1:n}). Prior work has shown that introducing "thinking" or safe reasoning patterns into the generation context can effectively guide an LLM to mitigate risks and correct its own mistakes~\cite{bib.bib34 bib.bib25 bib.bib29}. This inspired us to design an intervention that acts on the context itself generating an adaptive reflective pattern to guide the correction of the unsafe path.
