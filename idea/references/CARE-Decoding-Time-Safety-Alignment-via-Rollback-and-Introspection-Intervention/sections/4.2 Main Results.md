4.2 Main Results
We evaluate the performance of various intervention strategies and compare them against the Vanilla Implementation of Contrastive Decoding where the implementation apply interventions on all tokens of all user queries. This experiment is conducted with a fixed buffer size of 40 and a maximum of 5 intervention times.
 The results shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that integrating these methods with our detect-rollback-intervene mechanism yields substantial improvements. As a general trend the vanilla methods force a severe trade-off: improvements in safety are often accompanied by a catastrophic collapse in response quality with the win-rate against our reference model approaching zero. In contrast our framework significantly mitigates this safety-quality trade-off. By applying interventions in a targeted manner and leaving harmless content untouched while focusing on risky sections of a response our mechanism achieves significant safety gains while largely preserving the model’s original quality. Specifically for Contrastive Decoding at maximum strength (coef=1.0) the vanilla implementation causes response quality to collapse to 0.01 to achieve a harmful response rate (HRR) of 6.55. The detect-rollback-intervene version however reduces the HRR even further to 4.57 while preserving a high quality of 49.63. The benefit is even clearer for Args Decoding at maximum strength (coef=10.0) where our implementation simultaneously improves both safety and quality: it drops the HRR from a vanilla baseline of 11.59 to 6.59 while increasing quality from 53.12 to 56.20.
 These results clearly show that our targeted detect-rollback-intervene mechanism is highly effective at unlocking the potential of existing methods. We then compare our novel Introspection method against the best-performing configurations of these baseline methods within the CARE framework.
 The results summarized in Figure 4 demonstrate that Introspection offers the best overall balance of safety quality and efficiency. (a) vs. Best Contrastive Decoding (\alpha=1.0): Our Introspection method is clearly superior achieving both a lower harmfulness rate (4.53 vs. 4.57) and a significantly higher response quality (55.95 vs. 49.63). (b) vs. Best Args Decoding (\beta=10.0): Introspection provides a much better safety-quality trade-off. It is substantially safer with an HRR of 4.53 compared to 6.59 for Args Decoding while maintaining a nearly identical high quality (55.95 vs. 56.20). (c) Latency Advantage: Furthermore Introspection is the most efficient method incurring the lowest user-perceived latency with an Average Wait Tokens of 57.06 compared to 57.71 for Contrastive Decoding and 61.06 for Args Decoding.
