4.3 No Free Lunch: The Trade-off Between Performance and Latency
While our framework is effective there is an inherent trade-off between intervention performance and user-perceived latency. In this section we investigate this trade-off by exploring two strategies for increasing intervention intensity measured via the total Average Wait Tokens (AWT). Using our Introspection method we analyze:
 •
 Buffer Scaling: Increasing the buffer size while keeping the maximum number of retry times fixed.
 •
 Retry Scaling: Increasing the maximum number of retry times while keeping the buffer size fixed.
 To investigate these strategies we start from a shared baseline configuration of a 40-token buffer and a single retry attempt. From this point we apply buffer scaling and retry scaling independently. The resulting performance plotting both Harmful Response Rate and Response Quality against the corresponding Average Wait Tokens is shown in Figure 5.
 Our experiments lead to two key findings. First as shown across both plots increasing the intervention budget (and thus the Wait Tokens) successfully improves safety. For both scaling strategies a higher AWT budget leads to a lower Harmful Response Rate. However this comes at a cost: this increased intervention also causes a gradual decline in overall Response Quality confirming the fundamental trade-off between safety and quality.
 Second and more importantly our results reveal that buffer scaling is a significantly more effective and efficient strategy than retry scaling. As shown in Figure 5(a).sf1 the safety improvement from retry scaling quickly diminishes with the Harmful Response Rate plateauing around 4.5 even as the latency cost increases. In contrast buffer scaling is far more potent. At a similar latency cost it continues to drive the Harmful Response Rate down achieving a HRR of approximately 1.0 at 120 Wait Tokens with a continuing downward trend.
 This demonstrates that while there is no free lunch how one "spends" the latency budget is critical. For achieving the highest level of safety increasing the intervention’s foresight by using a larger buffer is a much better investment than simply retrying with a smaller one.

For buffer scaling, we fix the number of retries to one while varying the buffer size (b\in\{20,30,40,50,60\}). For retry scaling, we fix the buffer size to 20 while varying the number of retries (N\in\{1,9,16,22,28\}). In both cases, the listed hyperparameter values correspond to the data points on the plots from left to right.
