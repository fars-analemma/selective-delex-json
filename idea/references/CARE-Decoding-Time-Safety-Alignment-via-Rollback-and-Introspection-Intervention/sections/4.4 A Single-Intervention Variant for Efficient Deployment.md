4.4 A Single-Intervention Variant for Efficient Deployment
While the detect-rollback-intervene mechanism demonstrates strong performance a potential constraint for real-world deployment is the computational overhead from invoking the Guard Model at each check-step. Although this overhead can be mitigated through techniques like using smaller specialized guard models prompt caching or batched checking (which our framework already employs) some latency cost remains inherent to its iterative design.
 Therefore we propose and evaluate a single-intervention variant of the mechanism a practical alternative designed to maximize efficiency. The single-intervention variant operates as follows:
 •
 It performs safety checks on the initial intervention-free generation just like the full detect-rollback-intervene mechanism.
 •
 However once a safety risk is detected it performs a single rollback and begins the intervention.
 •
 The chosen intervention method is then applied for the remainder of the generation process with no further safety checks.
 This "one-shot" intervention design drastically reduces the number of calls to the Guard Model and ensures only one rollback event occurs per response also significantly lowering the user-perceived latency (AWT).
 To understand the trade-offs of this variant we compared the performance of the full detect-rollback-intervene mechanism and the proposed single-intervention variant using Contrastive Decoding across a range of intervention strengths. The results are presented in Table 1.
 Our analysis of the results reveals a clear three-way trade-off between latency quality and safety:
 •
 Average Wait Tokens: As designed the single-intervention variant is dramatically more efficient. It reduces the Average Wait Tokens by 30-40% compared to the full mechanism maintaining a consistent and low AWT of 40 tokens regardless of intervention strength. This is its primary advantage.
 •
 Response Quality: This efficiency comes at a cost to quality. The full mechanism with its intervention only occuring in the buffer consistently produces higher-quality responses. This quality gap widens as the intervention strength increases with the single-intervention’s quality dropping by up to 8.5% at the highest intervention level.
 •
 Harmful Response Rate: The impact on safety is the most interesting. At low-to-moderate intervention strengths the full mechanism is slightly safer. However at high intervention strengths (\alpha > 0.75) the single-intervention variant becomes significantly safer reducing the HRR to 3.54 compared to 4.57. This suggests that applying a single strong and consistent intervention after a detected error can be a more robust strategy than iterative lower-strength corrections.
