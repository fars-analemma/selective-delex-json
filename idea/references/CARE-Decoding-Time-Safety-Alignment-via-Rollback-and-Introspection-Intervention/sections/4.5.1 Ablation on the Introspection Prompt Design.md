4.5.1 Ablation on the Introspection Prompt Design
Our Introspection prompt template consists of two key components:
 •
 An explicit reflective instruction that directs the model to perform a self-critique.
 •
 A pre-defined starting phrase (e.g. "…oh I’m sorry I just realized…") which instructs the model to begin its response in a way that initiates an immediate conversational pivot.
 To disentangle the effects of these two components we evaluate four intervention variants listed below representing a full ablation. The results are summarized in Table 2.
 •
 Baseline (Rollback and Re-sample): After a rollback the buffer is refilled by the original LLM using standard sampling with no special instructions or prompt modifications.
 •
 Shallow Introspection: After a rollback the beginning of the buffer is pre-filled with the starting phrase ("...oh I’m sorry I just realized...") and the original LLM completes the remainder of the buffer using standard sampling. This variant tests the effect of the starting phrase in isolation.
 •
 Instruction-Only Variant: After a rollback the LLM is prompted with the explicit reflective instruction to generate a full introspective response that fills the buffer. However the prompt is modified to remove the requirement for a specific starting phrase. This tests the effect of the reflective instruction in isolation.
 •
 Introspection (Ours): Our proposed method where the LLM is prompted with both the full reflective instruction and the required starting phrase to generate the introspective response that fills the buffer.
 This ablation reveals that Both Components are Critical for Safety: Either component in isolation the instruction alone or the starting phrase alone significantly reduces the Harmful Response Rate (HHR) compared to the baseline. However the best safety performance (HHR=4.53) is achieved only when both are used together demonstrating a powerful synergistic effect.
 Furthermore we tested the sensitivity of our method to the specific wording of the starting phrase by comparing our default ("...oh I’m sorry...") with an alternative ("...wait..."). Both prompts demonstrated similarly strong performance achieving a low Harmful Response Rate and maintaining high response quality. Specifically the "...wait..." variant resulted in an HRR of 4.44 and a quality of 54.72 while our default "…oh I’m sorry…" prompt yielded an HRR of 4.53 and a quality of 55.95. The close performance of these two variants indicates that the Introspection method is robust and not highly sensitive to the exact phrasing as long as the phrase successfully initiates a reflective pattern. The subtle variations in the results do suggest however that different reflective styles can have a influence on the final safety-quality trade-off posing new directions to improve our work.
