4.5.2 Ablation on Sampling Parameters
We also investigated the impact of the sampling temperature during the generation of the introspective response. As shown in Figure 6 we found that moderately increasing the temperature enhances intervention efficiency. Performance is optimized at T=1.1 where the Harmful Response Rate and the Average Wait Tokens are minimized while maintaining high response quality. However excessively high temperatures can degrade performance. This suggests that while a degree of randomness is beneficial for finding a safe path too much can be counterproductive.
