6 Conclusion
In this paper we introduced CARE a novel framework that enhances decoding-time safety by integrating a seamless detect-rollback-intervene mechanism with a novel introspection-based intervention. Our comprehensive experiments show that this targeted approach resolves the severe safety-quality trade-off that plagues vanilla interventions . Furthermore our novel Introspection method provides a state-of-the-art balance of safety (low Harmful Response Rate) response quality and latency outperforming other strong intervention methods even after they are enhanced by our framework. Finally we show that our framework’s safety performance is scalable; through buffer scaling the harmful response rate can be continually reduced in exchange for user wait time offering a more effective scaling path than simply increasing retries . Overall CARE provides a powerful and flexible solution for deploying safer LLMs in real-world applications.
