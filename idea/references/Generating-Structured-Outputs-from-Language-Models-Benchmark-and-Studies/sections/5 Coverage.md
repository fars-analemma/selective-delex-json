5 Coverage
Each constrained decoding framework has limitations when it comes to translating JSON schemas into a set of constraints that can reliably guarantee the validity of LM outputs. To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these frameworks we define three notions of coverage:
 Definition 5.1 (Declared Coverage)
 A schema is considered declared covered if the framework processes the schema without explicitly rejecting it or encountering runtime errors such as exceptions or crashes.
 Definition 5.2 (Empirical Coverage)
 A schema is considered empirically covered if our experiments show that the constraints generated by the framework result in LM outputs that are schema-compliant.
 Definition 5.3 (True Coverage)
 A schema is considered truly covered if the framework produces constraints that are precisely equivalent to the original JSON Schema definition i.e. permitting all schema-compliant generations while rejecting all schema-noncompliant generations.
 The most ideal coverage metric is the true coverage denoted as \cal{C}_{\text{True}}. However due to the infinite number of JSON instances that could be validated against a schema it is difficult to measure in practice without a formal verification method that is capable of exhaustively comparing the schema’s semantics against the framework’s implementation. \cal{C}_{\text{Empirical}} is an approximation of \cal{C}_{\text{True}} as it only checks whether the finitely many outputs seen during our experiments conform to a given schema3Additionally we define theoretical coverage as the proportion of schemas whose features are fully supported by the grammar engine with details provided in Appendix C[ref_id]A3..
 While \cal{C}_{\text{Declared}} is not an estimate of \cal{C}_{\text{True}} per se it is an upper-bound of both \cal{C}_{\text{Empirical}} and \cal{C}_{\text{True}} and is useful in deriving an additional metric from the coverage evaluation: Compliance Rate =\cal{C}_{\text{Empirical}}/\cal{C}_{\text{Declared}}. The Compliance Rate estimates the reliability of the constrained decoding framework in guaranteeing compliance given it accepts a given schema.
