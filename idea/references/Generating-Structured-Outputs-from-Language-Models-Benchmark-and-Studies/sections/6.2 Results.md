6.2 Results
The results in Table 8 show that the constrained decoding regardless of the framework achieves higher performance than the unconstrained setting. Among the frameworks evaluated Guidance consistently delivers the best performance across all tasks with approximately a 3% improvement over the LM-only approach in every task. We believe this may be attributed to its token-healing implementation~\cite{bib.bib15}.
