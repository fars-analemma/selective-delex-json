Compliance Rate
Compliance Rate
 Among open-source engines guidance consistently demonstrates the highest compliance rate across all datasets making it the most reliable option for ensuring schema compliance. Outlines has a comparatively lower compliance rate primarily due to timeouts during generation. Our analysis reveals that JSON Schema features like ‘minItems‘ ‘maxItems‘ ‘enum‘ and ‘Array’ while supported often take 40 seconds to 10 minutes for Outlines to process. LM-only exhibits the lowest compliance rate highlighting its unreliability as a standalone solution. While closed-source implementations have low empirical coverage they have very high compliance rates indicating that their providers have taken a more conservative strategy implementing only a subset of JSON Schema features that they can reliably support.
