 Our contributions are three-fold:
 •
 We assemble JSON schemas from various sources and organize them into a benchmark JSONSchemaBench to facilitate the evaluation of constrained decoding frameworks on JSON schema.
 •
 We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to assess the versatility of constrained decoding frameworks in handling diverse JSON schema features including declared coverage empirical coverage and compliance rate.
 •
 We evaluate six state-of-the-art constrained decoding frameworks on JSONSchemaBench uncovering their strengths and limitations in generating schema-compliant JSON outputs and analyzing their impact on downstream tasks.
