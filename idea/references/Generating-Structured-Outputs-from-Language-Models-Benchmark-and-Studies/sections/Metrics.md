 We break down the efficiency evaluation into the following components:
 •
 Grammar Compilation Time (GCT): The time spent on grammar compilation if applicable.
 •
 Time to First Token (TTFT): Time from the start of generation to the production of the first token.
 •
 Time per Output Token (TPOT): Average time to generate each output token after the first.
