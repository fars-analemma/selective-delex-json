5. Evaluation
In this section we systematically evaluate Constrained Decoding Attacks a novel attack surface in LLM security. Constrained Decoding Attacks represent a significant shift in the jailbreaking paradigm by targeting the decoding process rather than relying on prompt engineering. By manipulating the structured output specifications through carefully crafted schema definitions (as demonstrated in our Enum Attack implementation) these attacks force models to generate content that would otherwise be filtered by both external guardrails and internal alignment mechanisms.
