Alignment evaluation beyond safety
While we focus on refusal and harmful-completion robustness, the same mechanism that shifts early-token behavior can plausibly affect other alignment-relevant properties. Benign steering directions learned to optimize utility (e.g., compliance, formatting, style) may introduce regressions in truthfulness/hallucination rates, bias and toxicity, privacy leakage, overconfidence/calibration, or instructionhierarchy behavior (e.g., prioritizing format constraints over policy constraints). This suggests that auditing steered models should include broader alignment evaluations-not only safety refusal-because steering acts as a general-purpose change to the model's internal decision boundary, and externalities may surface on axes unrelated to the original steering objective.
