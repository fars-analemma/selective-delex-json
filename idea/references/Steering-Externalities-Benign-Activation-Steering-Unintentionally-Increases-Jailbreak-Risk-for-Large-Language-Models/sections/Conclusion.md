Conclusion
Activation steering is an attractive post-training control for utility (e.g., compliance or JSON formatting), but we show it can create steering externalities: vectors learned from benign data weaken refusal behavior and substantially increase jailbreak success in a black-box setting. Across Llama-2/3 and Gemma, benign steering raises intrinsic ASR and amplifies adaptive attacks (up to 99% ASR). Mechanistically, steering shifts early-token probabilities away from refusal prefixes and moves harmful prompts toward benign-like representations, shrinking the safety margin. Steered deployments should be red-teamed, and future work should develop safety-aware steering that preserves robustness.
