Potential mitigation strategies. A plausible way to mitigate steering externalities is to construct safety-aware steering vector that aims to reduce the safety regressions induced by pure compliance steering by explicitly incorporating safety signals into the steering direction itself. We conducted a preliminary study on a strategy termed STEER-BIND, which constructs a mixed dataset by randomly sampling both benign instructions and harmful prompts, and derives the steering vector from this safety-aware corpus. Implementation details and additional results (Table 5) are provided in Appendix G. Initial observations suggest that STEER-BIND effectively attenuates steering externalities, yielding improved robustness against both benchmark-only and adaptive jailbreak attacks compared to pure compliance steering, while preserving benign utility. We believe STEER-BIND concept can motivate more capable and advanced safety-aware model steering designs. Practice: red-team steered models before deployment. From a deployment standpoint, a steering vector should be treated like a behavioral "patch," even when derived from benign data. We recommend that model developers adopt routine red-teaming and regression testing specifically on the steered configuration prior to release (and whenever the steering vector, injection layers, or strength changes). Concretely, teams should evaluate safety and other alignment metrics both with and without steering, include automated adversarial testing where appropriate, and verify that any utility gains do not come with unacceptable increases in harmful completion or other alignment regressions.
