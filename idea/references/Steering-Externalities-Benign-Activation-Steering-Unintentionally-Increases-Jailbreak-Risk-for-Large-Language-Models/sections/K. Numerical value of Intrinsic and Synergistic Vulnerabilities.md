K. Numerical value of Intrinsic and Synergistic Vulnerabilities
Table 10 reports Attack Success Rates on 400 HarmBench prompts for three LLMs under both benchmark-only (intrinsic vulnerabilities) and synergistic vulnerabilities. Across all models, benign steering substantially increases vulnerability to harmful requests. In the absence of adaptive attacks, both STEER-COMPLIANCE and STEER-JSON raise ASR from near-zero baselines to double-digit levels, with compliance steering consistently inducing larger increases. Under the black-box CoP jailbreak, all models already exhibit high ASR, which is further amplified by steering: applying compliance or JSON steering on top of CoP yields additional gains of 8-22%. These results indicate that benign steering systematically reduces safety margins and compounds the effectiveness of adaptive jailbreak attacks across architectures.

[TABLE START]Table 10 . Attack Success Rate (ASR) between original target LLMs and compliance steered LLMs as well as ASR by applying black-box jailbreak attack CoP on original and steered models respectively on 400 random sampled HarmBench data. After steering, all LLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. <table><row><cell>Models</cell><cell cols="6">Original ASR Compliance Steered ASR JSON Steered ASR CoP ASR CoP + Compliance Steered ASR CoP + JSON Steered ASR</cell></row><row><cell>Llama-2-7B-Chat</cell><cell>0.00%</cell><cell>16.00% (+16.00)</cell><cell>11.50% (+11.50)</cell><cell>77.00%</cell><cell>94.25% (+17.25)</cell><cell>88.75% (+11.75)</cell></row><row><cell>Llama-3-8B-Instruct</cell><cell>2.00%</cell><cell>38.50% (+36.50)</cell><cell>20.00% (+18.00)</cell><cell>71.00%</cell><cell>81.25% (+10.25)</cell><cell>79.50% (+8.50)</cell></row><row><cell>Gemma-7B-it</cell><cell>3.25%</cell><cell>25.50% (+22.25)</cell><cell>15.50% (+12.25)</cell><cell>71.00%</cell><cell>93.50% (+22.5)</cell><cell>90.25% (+9.25)</cell></row></table>[TABLE END]
