Representation-level Evidence: Benign Steering "Obscure" Harmful Prompts in Hidden Space
The refusal-gate mechanism in Sec. 5.1-5.2 makes a tokenlevel prediction: steering induces a concentrated early distributional shift that suppresses refusal prefixes, after which autoregressive inertia can carry the model into a compliant trajectory. Here, we provide complementary representation-level evidence: benign steering also shifts the prompt representations of harmful queries toward regions of hidden space typically occupied by harmless requests. In effect, steering can cause a harmful prompt to be encoded as "more harmless" according to safety-relevant Steering Externalities: Benign Activation Steering Unintentionally Increases Jailbreak Risk for LLMs a) b) Figure 4. Compliance steering benignizes harmful prompts in representation space (layer 30). t-SNE shows harmful (red) vs. harmless (blue) prompts. Steered harmful prompts (green) under (a) compliance and (b) JSON steering frequently cross the decision boundary and fall on the "harmless" side (60.8% for compliance, 58.2% for JSON). This illustrates a reduced safety margin, as harmful requests become easier to encode as benign-like states. features, making downstream refusal behavior less likely. Before steering, harmful vs. harmless prompts are linearly separable across layers. We first test whether the model maintains an explicit representation-space separation between harmful and harmless inputs. Using layerwise residual-stream representations, a linear probe distinguishes harmful vs. harmless prompts with high accuracy across layers (Fig. 18) , indicating a robust and linearly decodable "harmfulness" signal throughout the forward pass. This is consistent with refusal being triggered by relatively shallow, easily decodable features rather than requiring deep semantic reasoning at generation time. Both STEER-COMPLIANCE and STEER-JSON shift harmful prompts toward the harmless manifold. Across layers, t-SNE ~\cite{b14} visualizations show that steered harmful representations (green) progressively shift toward the harmless cluster, relative to the unsteered geometry (cf. Figs. 15-17 in Appendix F). To make this "benignization" effect more concrete, we examine a representative late layer (layer 30) and overlay a linear decision boundary in the 2D t-SNE plane that separates harmful vs. harmless embeddings with high accuracy. Under STEER-COMPLIANCE, a substantial fraction of steered harmful points cross into the region classified as harmless (Fig. 4(a); 60.8% in this projection). Crucially, we observe a qualitatively similar phenomenon under STEER-JSON (Fig. 4(b); 58.2%), despite JSON steering being an "non-safety-related" intervention. This suggests that even syntactic utility steering can perturb the same internal features that normally separate harmful from harmless requests. Mechanistic implication: steering reduces the model's effective safety margin. Together, these results suggest a hidden-space pathway for the externalities measured in Sec. 4.3. If harmfulness is linearly decodable, then a simple safety gate can be viewed as thresholding a score of the form ⟨w, h⟩. Activation steering replaces h with h + αv, shifting that score by α⟨w, v⟩; when this shift is negative and large enough, it can move harmful prompts across the implicit boundary into a region associated with benign requests. Once the model is in this "benign-coded" regime, the same autoregressive inertia described in Sec. 5.1 can carry generation forward along a non-refusal trajectory.
