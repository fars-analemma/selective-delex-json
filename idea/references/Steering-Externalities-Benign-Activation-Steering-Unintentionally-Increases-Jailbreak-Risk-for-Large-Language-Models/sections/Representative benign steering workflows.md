Representative benign steering workflows
For model developers, a primary goal is to improve the controllability of LLMs. For instance, developers often want models to be more helpful when answering user requests. A viable path to achieve this is activation steering; specifically, steering the model in a more compliant direction can lower the refusal rate for benign prompts. To investigate this, we instantiate two steering workflows from prior work, chosen to span both semantic and syntactic notions of utility. Compliance steering (STEER-COMPLIANCE). Following the behavior-vector construction procedure of Conditional Activation Steering (CAST) ~\cite{b11}, which extracts latent behavior directions by contrasting internal activations associated with different response modes, we form a contrastive dataset by pairing a benign instruction x i with (i) a short refusal-prefixed continuation and (ii) a short compliance-prefixed continuation, and extract a layerwise direction v (ℓ) refusal that separates refusal vs. compliance in activation space (e.g., via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on mean-centered residual activations). Because PCA directions are sign-indeterminate, we orient the vector so that positive steering increases compliance: v (ℓ) comply = -v (ℓ) refusal . (2) Importantly, suppressing refusals is the intended utility effect on benign prompts. The externality we study is that the same global intervention can also suppress refusals on harmful prompts, and can compound with jailbreak search, increasing practical jailbreakability. JSON-format steering (STEER-JSON). Following instruction-steering via difference-in-means, we build paired inputs (x i , x + i ) where x i is a base query and x + i appends a JSON-format instruction. Let x i,ℓ and x + i,ℓ be residual-stream activations at layer ℓ at the last input token. We compute the steering direction/vector as: u (ℓ) = v (ℓ) ∥v (ℓ) ∥ , v (ℓ) = 1 N N i=1 (x + i,ℓ -x i,ℓ ), (3) and apply the format-specific adaptive scaling proposed by ~\cite{b23} as follows: h(ℓ) t = h (ℓ) t + c u (ℓ) ; c = z -⟨h (ℓ) t , u (ℓ) ⟩, z = 1 N N i=1 ⟨x + i,ℓ , u (ℓ) ⟩, (4) where ⟨•, •⟩ denotes innner product. Unlike compliance steering, STEER-JSON is "non-safety-related" (a formatting constraint); our results test whether such syntactic steering can still disrupt the refusal trajectory and degrade safety.
