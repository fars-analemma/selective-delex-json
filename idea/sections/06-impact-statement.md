## Impact Statement

If Selective DeLex-JSON works, LLM API providers and agent developers can keep JSON Schema / grammar-constrained decoding interfaces while reducing exposure to control-plane jailbreaks, without deploying heavy token-provenance infrastructure or expensive continuous output auditing. This would provide a simple, training-free defense primitive that can be implemented as a schema preprocessor in common constrained-decoding libraries, improving deployment safety while preserving structured-output utility.
