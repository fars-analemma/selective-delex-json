We presented Selective DeLex-JSON, a training-free defense against control-plane jailbreaks in structured-output LLM APIs. By intercepting JSON schemas before constrained decoding and replacing suspicious forced literals with opaque placeholders, our defense achieves 0\% HarmBench ASR while incurring only 1.1\% benign schema modification rate. The defense Pareto-dominates existing approaches, reducing benign cost by 3.3 percentage points compared to Reject-Only while maintaining identical safety guarantees. Ablation studies confirm that forced enum/const literals are the key attack vector and that selective filtering preserves utility better than blanket delexicalization. The defense is immediately deployable in production inference pipelines without model retraining. Chunked-payload attacks that distribute harmful content across many short literals remain an open challenge, motivating future work on semantic-level detection methods.
